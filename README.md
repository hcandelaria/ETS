# Project Title

EXP-Talent-System

## Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/hcandelaria/ETS.git


### Prerequisites

bcrypt is a native module for NodeJS, i.e, it uses native code to perform its work. The advantage of this over pure JS alternatives is speed. However, the disadvantage of this approach is it requires you to install a compiler and build dependencies in order to build.

windows run (as administrator): npm install --global --production windows-build-tools

ubuntu run: sudo apt-get install -y build-essential python

### Installing

npm install

## Running the tests
